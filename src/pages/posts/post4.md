What is it about salon-fresh hair that leaves it so swishy, bouncy and glorious? Even if you’re not booked in for a razzy blow dry, the wash alone leaves hair both silkier and more voluminous. How?
<br></br>
It's a question I put to my stylist recently (because I'm guessing you all want to know). "Is there a 'right way' to wash your hair, because whenever I do it myself at home, it never ends up with as much oomf or polish?" Her answer was interesting: “Most people who come to the basin have lovely, clean hair on top, then when you reach the mid-section of the crown and the bottom, it takes a bit longer to work through because it’s not been washed as thoroughly.” Huhh.
<br></br>
I asked my mates about how they wash their hair on Zoom. Most – having acted it out like a Herbal Essences advert – admitted that they focused their attention on the top of their scalp and either gave the hair near the nape of their neck a quick once over, or missed it out entirely, same as me. None of us sectioned our hair out so that we could really give the hair nestled at the centre of our crown a thorough cleanse.

“Putting a little bit of extra time and thought into how you wash your hair at home can leave you with that light, bouncy salon fresh feeling,” leading hair stylist, Hollie Rose Clarke, told me when I asked her if there was a solution. These are the easy tweaks she suggests to transform your usual hair wash into the formula for delicious swishy hair.
<br></br>
Brush your hair first
“Before you even get in the shower, brush your hair. This will help loosen dirt, remove stray hairs and untangle knots,” says Hollie
<br></br>
Make sure the temperature is just right
“Next up, water temperature is important. Wet your hair with lukewarm water. Water that’s too hot will open the hair cuticle and this will allow keratin proteins, your expensive salon colour and natural moisturising factors to escape," Hollie says. "It means hair loses not just colour, but strength, too.”
<br></br>
Double up on your shampoo
“Always, always wash your hair twice," she says. "The first shampoo removes dirt, pollution and product residue. The second shampoo essentially adds shine and gloss,” similar to double cleansing your complexion.

Stave off frizz
“Last, I’d recommend investing in a microfibre towel,” says Hollie. They’re much better for your hair, since the fibres won’t rough up your cuticles, which means less frizz. Plus, they absorb much more moisture which will help your hair to dry quicker.

So there you have it, the secret to salon fresh hair is more manageable than you’d think – it’s just a DIY scalp massage away.
