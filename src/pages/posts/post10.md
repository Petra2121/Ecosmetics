There are two primary concerns that I routinely see from consumers in the online beauty community and from readers with respect to glitter: 1) whether cosmetic-grade glitter is eye safe, and 2) concerns about plastic glitter and its impact on the environment.  Those concerns continue to be expressed more frequently as more brands include glitter in their product offerings, including products that may or may not be explicitly marketed for eyes but often are included in palettes that otherwise look like a typical eyeshadow palette.
<br></br>

### BACKGROUND
This post is focused on the first concern as I recently had to go to an eye doctor after-hours to have a plastic particle removed that had gotten stuck to my upper eyelid immediately after I removed my makeup (not during wear) that would not flush out at home. Fortunately, I walked away with minimal damage (antibiotics for a week and skip contacts for a few days), so I consider myself lucky and definitely think getting to the doctor sooner (about two hours) was the right move!

You can get a corneal abrasion or scratch on your eye through regularly-scheduled, mundane activities from inserting contact lenses (fingernails are often the culprits) to dust or sand getting into your eye to rubbing your eye.  If you accidentally stab yourself in the eye with a mascara wand or eye brush that could cause damage to the eye.  If you wear eye makeup, it makes sense to take care in the types of products used, ensure that they’re adhering well to the area, and take care removing it all.

### OPHTHALMOLOGY ON EYE SAFETY
In my quest to try and to provide information to readers, I considered looking to ophthalmologists, who would likely be the ones “seeing” the impacts of glitter.  A lot of ophthalmology organizations didn’t turn up any results when I tried searching their websites for glitter and/or cosmetics (generally) information or guidance. From the organization American Academy of Ophthalmology, they included the title of a section as “avoid glitter eye makeup” but go on to say be careful!

Be careful with metallic, glitter, sparkle powder or other makeup. Flakes can fall into the eye, get into the tear film and irritate your eyes. Glitter eye makeup is a common cause of corneal irritation or infection, especially for people who wear contact lenses. Larger glitter or inclusions in makeup can scratch the eye, much like getting sand or dirt in your eye.

### WHAT LITTLE I COULD FIND ON PET GLITTER SAFETY
You would think that it would be easy to ascertain if glitter was safe or if this ingredient was safe for this area or not, but alas, it is not so simple.  CosIng, which is the EU source for ingredient safety, seems to allow for use of PET glitter without restriction in cosmetics, but the in the US, when I’ve asked industry insiders and brand owners that I know, the consensus is that no glitter is approved by FDA for usage on the eye… and yet it is clearly being used by brands routinely.

Fellow blogger Phyrra tried to figure it all out in July 2012, and she corresponded with FDA, who said that “Glitter usually consists of aluminum, an approved color additive, bonded to an etched plastic film composed of polyethylene terephthalate. FDA considers glitter and mica-based composite pigments to be non-permitted color additives when used in FDA-regulated products, including cosmetics. However, we are exercising enforcement discretion for a period of time.”
