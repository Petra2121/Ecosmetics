Sales of lipstick are on the decline. Eye shadow, however… 
<br></br>
"Eyes are the windows to the soul," is a Biblically old phase, but it's also never been more true than in 2020. Since we rarely leave the house anymore, and a mask covers half our face even when we do, our once-anticipated morning cosmetic routines can feel a bit dissonant, an old habit from a world that no longer exists. Many former makeup lovers told Allure that the pandemic has caused them to ditch their 30-minute makeup routine for something more relaxed. But the eye makeup stays in the picture.

### Interview with Reina
Take Reina, a 25-year-old writer in Brooklyn. She says that even though she’s been wearing less makeup overall since the pandemic started, she’s still doing her eye makeup every single day. "And taking selfies," she said. "It sounds so vain, but it makes me feel better. And it reminds me that no matter how bad things get, I can still do a killer wing."

### We aren't performing for others
It makes perfect sense. Since we aren’t performing for others anymore — coworkers at the office, strangers on the subway — many of us no longer feel obligated to show off bold lips or a perfect highlight. But we can still add color to the one part of our face that remains visible to the outside world. For Reina, makeup has stopped being a form of public expression, but one only for herself: Her eye-makeup ritual serves as a distraction from our grim political climate, a spot of color in a dark world.
<br></br>
Her only rule: No rules. Textures were layered and blended. Color stretched from the eyelids up to the brows and over to the cheekbones. The resulting looks — the ones you see throughout this piece — reflected an optimism that, in the beauty industry at this moment, is becoming harder and harder to find.

### Eyeshadow or winged liner
It might seem a bit silly that so many of us still want to apply eyeshadow or winged liner when the most glamorous trip we might have planned is the one to the grocery store. But our masks — and, in many ways, our global circumstances — have stripped us of our individuality: We can no longer see our friends, pursue our hobbies, or even showcase our smiles. At least we can paint our eyelids the color of sunshine. A little light, where there once was none.
