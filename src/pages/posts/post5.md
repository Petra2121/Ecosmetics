Good afternoon! Hi, friend. Happy Friday eve. You might already know this, but I have an online store (connorclaire.com) in addition to Makeup and Beauty Blog. It’s been a fun side project since a few months before Coywolf was born in 2016, where two of my favorite things — cats and makeup! — collide. Please check it out if you haven’t already. You’ll find some cute tees, bags and other things.
<br></br>
During this surreal, indescribably crazy time in history, I’ve had a chance to slow down a little, and that, at least, has been an unexpected gift. I’ve started to focus more on connorclaire.com again, which means a slew of new products coming atcha soon.
<br></br>
First up…a summery update on our bestselling Long Live Lipstick Tee.
<br></br>
This summery new version comes in a breezy white tank top now to keep ya cool on those hot summer days and nights!
<br></br>
It’s one of those shirts you’ll be wearing all season long.
<br></br>
I hope you stop by my little “corner shop” sometime soon. And if you’ve purchased anything from the store before, thank you so much for supporting this here small business! It means a lot to me. I’m excited to bring more cute cat- and beauty-related goodness to brighten your days and bring a smile to your face.
