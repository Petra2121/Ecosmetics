Collagen. It’s the bouncy protein that makes up the main scaffolding of our skin. It’s what gives our skin strength and elasticity and it’s responsible for making our complexions look smooth, youthful, plump and supple. Essential stuff.

It doesn’t stop at our complexions. “Collagen is basically the ingredient that holds everything together in the body,” explains Lisa Borg, nutritionist at Pulse Light Clinic. It’s essential for keeping our bones strong. “It supports joints and tendons and it strengthens hair, teeth and nails,” says Lisa.

Sounds like good stuff, right? Except, of course, as we age, our bodies ability to produce collagen depletes. And, when our bodies are low on collagen, “it is used for more essential repairs such as muscle building,” says Lisa, which means our complexions don’t get much of a look-in.

Our face creams can help, but they may have limitations, since collagen molecules are too large to be absorbed by our skin in their raw form. “They can however help to give the appearance of plumper skin while in place,” says Lisa. To really make a difference, look out for hydrolyzed collagen or collagen peptides, “these are small enough to penetrate the skin and get to the deeper layers of the dermis. So if you are using skincare ingredients that contain collagen, they will need to get to this level to have any impact,” explains dermatologist, Dr Elif Benar.

So where does that leave us? “By far the best way to top up our collagen levels is to consume foods high in collagen [high protein foods like beef, eggs, chicken, and fish] or to supplement with high quality collagen capsules or powders that can be added to liquid based foods like soups and stews,” says Lisa.

### Where does the collagen in collagen supplements come from?
“Supplements vary in their source and type: Bovine collagen supplements [from cattle] are the most common and consist of collagen types one and three; these are popularly promoted for hair, skin, and nail health. Collagen sourced from fish, which is growing in popularity, contains primarily type one collagen,” says Dr Elif.

### Are there any you would recommend?
“I only recommend those from reputable sellers who do not use preservatives, additives or fillers,” says Lisa. Basically, buying off random sites on the internet is a bad move. Stick to places like Boots, Holland & Barrett, Cult Beauty, Look Fantastic and Feel Unique. And make sure you read through the ingredients list – fillers to avoid include carrageenan and titanium dioxide.
